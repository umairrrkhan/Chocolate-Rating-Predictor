# Chocolate-Rating-Predictor

The Chocolate-Rating-Predictor is a project that aims to predict chocolate ratings using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes Python along with various libraries for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in this project:
- `numpy` (`np`)
- `pandas` (`pd`)
- `matplotlib.pyplot` (`plt`)
- `seaborn` (`sns`)
- `sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`
- `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`
- `tensorflow` (`tf`)

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is named `flavors_of_cacao.csv`. This dataset contains information about different types of chocolate, including various attributes such as the percentage of cocoa, company name, country of origin, and rating. The goal of the project is to build a model that can predict chocolate ratings based on these attributes.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```
4. Place the `flavors_of_cacao.csv` dataset file in the project directory.
5. Open the project's main script file (e.g., `chocolate_rating_predictor.py`).
6. Run the script to perform data preprocessing, analysis, and model training.
7. The trained model will be saved and can be used for making predictions.

## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command.
3. Run the main script using the following command:
```bash
python chocolate_rating_predictor.ipynb
```
4. The script will preprocess the data, perform exploratory analysis, train the model, and generate predictions.
